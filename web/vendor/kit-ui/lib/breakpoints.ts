/**
 * Canonical responsive breakpoints, formalized from Forge's mobile work.
 *
 * CSS media queries cannot read custom properties, so components must write
 * the pixel values inline — but only these values. `kit-ui-check` flags any
 * other width in an `@media` rule of a consuming project.
 *
 *   compact  ≤ 640px — phones; single-column layouts. (Type sizing is NOT
 *                      width-based — the theme.css tokens resize on handheld
 *                      touch devices via MEDIA.handheld.)
 *   medium   ≤ 760px — small tablets / split panels collapse
 *   wide     ≤ 900px — narrow desktop; secondary sidebars collapse
 *
 * In JS, prefer `MediaQuery` from svelte/reactivity over manual matchMedia:
 *
 *   import { MediaQuery } from "svelte/reactivity";
 *   import { MEDIA } from "@kenn-io/kit-ui";
 *
 *   const compact = new MediaQuery(MEDIA.compact);
 *   // compact.current is reactive
